Title

Drive Value; Minimise Risks

Description
-----------

Most companies innovate to reduce costs, increase efficiency, increase market share, improve customer engagement and/or leverage a competitive advantage. However innovation costs money, therefore the quicker you can prove the value of your innovation the less risk and cost is associated with its investment.

MVP, or Minimal Viable Product, approaches innovation based on validation rather than assumptions. MVPs can be defined as the version of an application which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least amount of investment.

Using the MVP approach, with Azure and PaaS as an enabler, Readify has repeatedly countered the traditional pain points of project-based delivery such as overblown scope, big bang deployments, long funding cycles, waste and inefficiency, lack of measurement and lack of realisation of outcomes, etc.

This presentation was first delivered as a Readify event at [Microsoft Perth](https://readify.net/events/?event-id=66E32722-44E7-4207-94E5-6C3CAD51FDC0) on March 4th 2016.
