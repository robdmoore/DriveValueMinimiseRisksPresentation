Drive Value; Minimise Risks

Description
-----------

Innovation and agility are top of mind of most CXOs in this increasingly competitive globally connected world.

Most companies innovate to reduce costs, increase efficiency, increase market share, improve customer engagement and/or leverage a competitive advantage. However innovation costs money, therefore the quicker you can prove the value of your innovation the less risk and cost is associated with its investment.

It's becoming more and more common for our software development teams to embrace techniques like Continuous Delivery and work with business stakeholders and product owners to drive high quality output. This is great, but why do companies still struggle with waste and inefficiency, overblown scopes, big bang deployments, long funding cycles, a lack of information-based decisions (instead opting for gut feel and momentum to make decisions), and a lack of realisation of expected business outcomes? These problems are making it hard to innovate.

This talk explores why this is still the case even though the Agile Manifesto is 15 years old, how we can start addressing it with gradual continuous improvement, where MVPs fit in with that solution and where the end goal would be for the kind of cultural change that is required. A number of practical ideas are presented - some of them can be used right away by attendees, others can be built towards over time.

This presentation was first delivered as a Readify event at [Microsoft Perth](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/drive-value-manage-risks-tickets-20717530692) on March 4th 2016.
