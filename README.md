Title

Drive Value; Minimise Risks

Description
-----------

Most companies innovate to reduce costs, increase efficiency, increase market share, improve customer engagement and/or leverage a competitive advantage. However innovation costs money, therefore the quicker you can prove the value of your innovation the less risk and cost is associated with its investment.

MVP, or Minimal Viable Product, approaches innovation based on validation rather than assumptions. MVPs can be defined as the version of an application which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning with the least amount of investment. Readify has a proud history of working with customers to deliver rapid innovation with reduced risk and cost using MVPs.

Using the MVP approach, with Azure and PaaS as an enabler, Readify has repeatedly countered the traditional pain points of project-based deliver such as overblown scope, big bang deployments, long funding cycles, waste and inefficiency, lack of measurement and lack of realisation of outcomes, etc.

Nowhere is MVP more relevant than in the Mobility space which is now a mainstay platform for organisations and consumers alike. Fortunately the maturity of modern mobility tooling and practice, combined with cloud and MVPs, means organisations can explore the mobile opportunity from multiple angles, quicker and more cost effectively than ever before.

This presentation was first delivered as a Readify event at [Microsoft Perth](https://readify.net/events/?event-id=66E32722-44E7-4207-94E5-6C3CAD51FDC0) on March 4th 2016.
